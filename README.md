# FDD-with-XAI
This python script developed approach which uses various Explainable AI techniques to interpret the results given by fault detection and diagnosis model for Air Handling Units.
Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems consume a significant amount of energy in buildings and can experience faults when not 
properly maintained, resulting in increased energy consumption and maintenance costs. To address this issue, it is important to develop an efficient Fault Detection and Diagnosis (FDD) system. Due to the availability of data, researchers are leaning towards data-driven approaches that use Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. However, the lack of transparency of ML algorithms makes stakeholders hesitant to adopt them for FDD. Therefore, this study examines the use of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques to improve FDD in Air Handling Units, enhancing their interpretability. Four ML techniques were evaluated based on fault detection rate and F1 score, and XGBoost was determined to be the optimal choice for the FDD model. The study utilized SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlainations) for interpreting the developed model. The SHAP summary plot and the SHAP waterfall plot used for global and local explanations, respectively. The study successfully demonstrated the effectiveness of XAI techniques in improving the transparency and interpretability of ML models for FDD in Air Handling Units.
